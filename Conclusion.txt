Conclusion: In the first task two Python scripts were created. The first script allows you to enter three integer variables, sort them in ascending order and display the result. Only three if statements are used for sorting. The second script creates a list with elements of different types and counts the number of string elements in this list. The result is displayed on the screen. Both scripts used only basic Python constructs to solve problems.
